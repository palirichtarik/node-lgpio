## groupRead() function

This returns the levels read from a group.

**Signature:**

export declare function groupRead(handle: number, gpio: number): bigint;
```

## Parameters

<tbody><tr><td>

handle


</td><td>

number


</td><td>

The GPIO device handle as returned by [gpiochipOpen()](./lgpio.gpiochipopen.md)


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

gpio


</td><td>

number


</td><td>

The group leader GPIO number


</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

**Returns:**

bigint

The values of the GPIOs in the group

## Remarks

This command will work for an output group as well as an input group. For an output group the value returned will be that last written to the group GPIO.

Note that this command will also work on an individual GPIO claimed as an input or output as that is treated as a group with one member.

The return value is a bitmask of the levels of the individual GPIOs in the group, with the LSB (bit 0) being the group leader, bit 1 being the second GPIO in the group, bit 2 being the third GPIO and so on.
